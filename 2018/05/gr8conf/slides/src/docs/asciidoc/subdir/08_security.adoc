=== **Security**

[%step]
* Did I mention that +++<span style="color:#e535ab;font-weight:bold;">GraphQL</span>+++ is a query language ?
* It *knows nothing* about security mechanisms
* We have to make the engine aware of security...
* Using the **Context**

=== Context

[%step]
* Can carry **information from outside** to the GraphQL execution flow
* Can be **any type** of data structure (Map, List...)
* **Available through all** the execution flow (instrumentations and data fetchers)

=== Two strategies

=== Using Instrumentation

[%step]
* More control
* Harder to integrate with Ratpack's execution model

=== Using REST + Instrumentation

[%step]
* You can use already implemented integrations (Pac4j)
* Easier to integration with Ratpack's execution runtime
