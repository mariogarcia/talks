=== **Security**

[%step]
* Did I mention that +++<span style="color:#e535ab;font-weight:bold;">GraphQL</span>+++ is a query language ?
* It *knows nothing* about security mechanisms
* We have to make the engine aware of security...
* Using the "context"

=== Context

[%step]
* Can be any type of data structure (Map, List...)
* Will carry information from **HTTP** to the GraphQL execution flow
* Available through all the execution flow (instrumentations and data fetchers)

=== Using JUST intrumentations

[%step]
* More control
* Harder to integrate with Ratpack's execution runtime
* Limited

=== Using HTTP authentication

[%step]
* You can use already implemented solutions (Pac4j)
* Easier to integration with Ratpack's execution runtime
