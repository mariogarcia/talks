=== **Summary**: +++<span style="color:#e535ab;font-weight:bold;">GraphQL</span>+++...

[%step]
* Is not a one-for-all technology
** You have one endpoint that only does one thing...
** Maybe REST is what you need
* Is specially an improvement **interacting** with the **front-end**
* GraphQL It's not limited to HTTP
* As a query language is still underestimated
* Still requires more traction

=== Questions ?

=== Thanks!
