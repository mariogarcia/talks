=== What is GraphQL

[%step]
- Is a **query language**
- Is also a **server-side runtime** spec
- It uses a **type system** to define those queries

=== What is **NOT** GraphQL

[%step]
- Is not a web framework
- Is not about HTTP
- And definitely, definitely, definitely...
- **GraphQL is not REST**

=== GraphQL vs Rest

[%notitle]
image::rest.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== Why we could want to move to GraphQL ?

=== First of all

[%step]
- While REST is an architectural concept
- GraphQL is just a query language

=== Differences

[%step]
* `Resources vs Queries`
** **Rest**: 1 URI ==> 1 resource
** **GraphQL**: 1 URI ==> n dataset
* `Application layer`
** **Rest** == HTTP
** **GraphQL** is not tied to any specific protocol
* `Front-End friendly`
** **Rest**: Back end is the king +++<span class="fragment">...and the bottleneck</span>+++

=== +++<span style="color:white;">No problem. I'll see what I can do</span>+++

=== The challenge

[%step]
- I want to expose all James Bond films information
- Users will **ONLY** use web browsers+++<span class="fragment"><strong>...FOR NOW</strong></span>+++
- +++<span class="fragment"><strong>BUT</strong></span>+++ we have to be ready for mobile +++<span class="fragment"><strong>AT SOME POINT</strong></span>+++

=== What do we do ?

+++
<table class="explanation_table">
   <tr>
      <td><img src="./images/rest_under_pressure_initial_state.png"></td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
         <ul class="ulist">
           <li class="fragment"><p>We build up <strong>1 API endpoint</strong></p></li>
           <li class="fragment"><p>Only targets <strong>1 device</strong></p></li>
           <li class="fragment"><p>Still we can create <strong>a couple of views</strong> for the same data</p></li>
         </ul>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>

=== Then shit happens!

[%notitle]

=== And normally gets worst

Users want to see A, B, and C in user home

[%notitle]
image::rest_under_pressure_2.png[]

[%step]
- Front end could **reuse** views
- and/or **aggregate calls**
- still may not be enough and they will start asking back-end to do more... `and more` ... **and more**...

[%notitle]
=== Then shit happens (III)

[%notitle]
image::rest_under_pressure_reaction.gif[]

=== Then you remember that...

[%step]
- **ONLY** means **in addition**
- **FOR NOW** means **within the next two weeks**
- **BUT** means **winter is coming!**
- and of course...**AT SOME POINT** means probably **next week**

=== GraphQL + HTTP to the rescue!

[%notitle]
=== Because shit happens

image::rest_under_pressure_graphql_schema.png[]

=== What changed ?

[%step]
- GraphQL HTTP endpoint as a **common query interface**
- Therefore **a lot more flexibility for front end**
- Your REST/NOT-REST **microservices will be easier to maintain**
- Will be easier to **keep one single responsability** in each one of them
