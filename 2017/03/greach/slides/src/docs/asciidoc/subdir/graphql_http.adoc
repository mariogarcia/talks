=== Why we could want to move to GraphQL ?

=== REST : Pros

[%step]
- An URI represents a single resource
- Cacheable

=== Cons

[%step]
* More limited views (Grails JSON views are great though!)
* Back end is the king +++<span class="fragment">...and the bottleneck</span>+++
* Oh, so you want a new endpoint/view to expose the same domain but
different properties ?


=== +++<span style="color:white;">No problem. I'll see what I can do</span>+++
